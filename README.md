# MDM2_Project_1_Pollinators

## Data_cleaner and Importances files

These intake data from the first link on the google doc that hongze uploaded.

They will work together to return the weighting (significace) of the impact of indervidual features on the number of interactions between a **specific** pollinator and plants.

Note: This requires a dataset of one pollinator at a time. The files focus on extracting the relationship between that pollinator and different features, and should be used later on in the modelling process for further analysis.

Please clone the files before commiting any changes.
