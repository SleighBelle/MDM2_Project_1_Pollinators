# MDM2_Project_1_Pollinators

## Data_cleaner and Importances files

These intake data from the first link on the google doc that hongze uploaded.

They will work together to return the weighting (significace) of the impact of indervidual features on the number of interactions between a **specific** pollinator and plants.

Note: This requires a dataset of one pollinator at a time. The files focus on extracting the relationship between that pollinator and different features, and should be used later on in the modelling process for further analysis.

Please clone the files before commiting any changes.

## MLTest file

This uses 4 types of ML model to return the weight (Importance) of different features and visualises them by bar chart.

Using SHAP Value analysis to show the influence of features affect the pollination.

## Location file
This visualise the location of the pollination bewteen bee and plants (flower_visted). Different color of dot stands for various types of bee while the size of it means the amount of plants has interactio with. 

Problem Remained: UK map is unable to plot under the 2D dot graph.
